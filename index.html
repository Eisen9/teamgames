Codenames is a 2015 card game for 4‚Äì8 players designed by Vlaada Chv√°til and published by Czech Games Edition. Two teams compete by each having a "spymaster" give one-word clues that can point to multiple words on the board. The other players on the team attempt to guess their team's words while avoiding the words of the other team. In a variant with 2‚Äì3 players, one spymaster gives clues to the other player or players. Find out more <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codenames_(board_game)">here</a>
